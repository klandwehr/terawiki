# About TeraWiki.
You can even edit the wiki yourself! Its written completley in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown Cheat Sheet"). That means you don't have to know the first think about coding to even use this page! It also has a different kind of database than many people are use to. The database itself is called MongoDB and it is a flavor of NoSQL this means that it's a non-relational database that doesn't enforce a schema. It makes it really easy to do things like search quickly for any word above and find the resulting page.  

If you would like to know more about the specifics of how this wiki works then keep reading. Otherwise start your search on the left side of the screen in the navigation panel.

## About Sub-Content
You can write sub-content in your pages and it will automatically fill into the navigation bar as a place you can click and instantly be the top of your screen. Check it out on the left! You can see that we are on the home page in the section "About TeraWiki" and under that you can see a section "About Sub-Content." It makes it really nice to be able to navigate quickly when there are a lot of things we could be interested in. If you are writing a page on TeraWiki please use this feature so that others can quickly navigate to relevent content.
