# About TeraWiki.
The first thing to note is the navigation panel on the left side of the screen. You can navigate by clicking on a page then its page contents.

You can even edit the wiki yourself! Its written completley in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown Cheat Sheet"). That means you don't have to know the first think about coding to even use this page!
