# About TeraWiki.
You can even edit the wiki yourself! Its written completley in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown Cheat Sheet"). That means you don't have to know the first think about coding to even use this page! It also has a different kind of database than many people are use to. The database itself is called MongoDB and it is a flavor of NoSQL this means that it's a non-relational database that doesn't enforce a schema. It makes it really easy to do things like search quickly for any word above and find the resulting page.  

If you would like to know more about the specifics of how this wiki works then keep reading. Otherwise start your search on the left side of the screen in the navigation panel.
